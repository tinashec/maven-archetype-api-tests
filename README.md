This is a Maven archetype project for creating an E2E API testing framework. The framework uses RestAssured as the rest client and TestNG as the test framework. When creating a testing framework from scratch there is a lot to consider. Things like, the test framework (TestNG, jUnit), the rest clients, the reporting tools, and the software build management (Gradle or Maven), will the tests be data-driven? What is the structure of the project itself (where do the test classes go, where do I put the endpoints, where do I put the payload)? All this can be overwhelming as you start. The goal of this archetype is to help those with these questions, to generate a project with everything set up and have them running E2E API tests with just a few commands.
